Abstract

This case study presents an innovative, non-surgical, home-based method for managing flexible Congenital Talipes Equino-Varus (CTEV) in newborns.
The method uses cotton padding and transparent cellotape for daily adjustable immobilization, empowering parents to participate directly in correction.

Correction is demonstrated in three stages:

1. Before – classical CTEV deformity.


2. During – immobilization with cotton + cellotape.


3. After – normalized plantigrade feet after several months.



Within 4–6 months, most flexible cases show significant improvement without plaster casts or surgery.
This method is low-cost, parent-friendly, and suitable for rural or resource-limited settings, offering a practical alternative to Ponseti casting.

Methodology

Patient: Neonate with bilateral flexible CTEV, treated at CHCA.

Steps:

1. Gentle foot manipulation.


2. Cotton padding wrapped around foot/ankle.


3. Transparent cellotape applied for immobilization.


4. Parents instructed to reapply daily.


5. Weekly clinical review ensured progressive correction.

Discussion

Advantages:

Avoids surgery.

Minimal cost.

Parent-friendly, empowering caregivers.

Rural-suitable alternative to plaster casting.


Limitations:

Only effective for flexible CTEV in neonates.

Resistant/rigid cases → orthopedic referral.


Relapse prevention: Night splints + stretching post-correction.



---

Conclusion

The cotton + cellotape innovation is a safe, effective, and low-cost approach for flexible CTEV management.
It enables successful correction within months, without surgery or heavy casting, and is especially impactful in resource-limited rural healthcare settings.
